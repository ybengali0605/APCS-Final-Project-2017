Introduction:

Long ago, a dogfighter by the name of Bob Marley was returning home. With both a high kill record and top marks from the academy, he was well renowned as the best pilot in Britain. But, as he was landing in the runway, he was suddenly sucked into a portal that lead him into the future. In the strange land he is now in, dogfighting is a way of life. Now, equipped with brand new futuristic tech, will he triumph over the other champions of the air? Or will he just end up as fodder for the others? 
	
Description:

Aerial Royale is a multiplayer game combat game with a setting in the surreal skies. In Aerial Royale, players can choose one of numerous different characters ranging from Corgi to Harry Potter. The point of the game is to defeat your opponent through rapid fire and the use of special weapons, unique to your character. The rules to this game are simple. Each player is given a primary key which fires bullets. This is the main way to duel your opponent and it does not have any built in cooldown or recoil damage. Each character also comes equipped with four special abilities. These abilities have a range of use from reflecting an attack to firing a powerful missile. Every character has their own strengths and weaknesses, some are more defensive, while others rely on quick successive attacks. This game solves not alleviates one’s boredom, but the innate need to demolish a friend in air-to-air combat. Children and young adults looking to have fun with a friend will definitely use and enjoy this aerial combat game. A few of the primary features our program comes with is user friendly GUI and 2D graphics, effectively placed keyboard controls, and different characters with unique abilities.  

Instructions:

Player 1: WASD, the keys for moving around. Use 1234 to toggle between your special abilities, and use space to fire your current one!
Player 2: Arrow keys,  the keys more moving around. Use 7890 to toggle between your special abilities and use P to fire your current one!

Main Screen: two panels are available to choose from. A controls panel and a battle panel.

Controls Panel: A list of the user controls and where the pause button is located.

Battle Arena: A split screen in which each player can choose what character they would like to play and then select the lock in button. There is also an undo button that can be selected to choose a different character. Once both players have locked in, a Battle button will appear which will then take both players to the arena to duel. 

To defeat your opponent, get their health bar down to zero. Avoid dying by dodging skill shots and using abilities when necessary. Keep in mind that each ability has a set cooldown so choose wisely on when to use them! The pause button is located at the top right of the screen when in battle. Good luck in the arena!
